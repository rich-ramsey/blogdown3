### Why am I writing a blog?

Two reasons.

-   It represents part of a lab manual (of sorts). It therefore saves time re-saying things to SoBA-lab people, so it is efficient.

-   Open science. Why not make stuff open? Then other folks can benefit and I can benefit from feedback.

### What will I blog about?

Boring stuff, like:

-   Reproducibility.

-   Meta-science.

-   Cognitive neuroscience.

-   Data analysis.

And inspirational stuff, like:

### Why should you read this blog?

You shouldn't. Please go and do other things.

### Why is the blog called Chasing Rainbows?

Ever since the Open Science Collaboration paper, which showed reproducibility levels in leading psychology journals at \~30%, I've felt like a lot of science has been inherently chasing rainbows, pissing in the wind or engaging in Cargo Cult Science.

I particularly like the idea of Cargo Cult Science from Richard Feynman [(.pdf)](./img/Feynman_74_CargoCult.pdf){target="_blank"}.
