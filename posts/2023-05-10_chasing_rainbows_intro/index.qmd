### Why am I writing a blog?

Two reasons.

-   It represents part of a lab manual (of sorts). It saves time re-saying things to SoBA-lab people or anyone else that cares to listen.

-   Open science. Why not make stuff open? Then other folks can benefit and I can benefit from feedback.

### What will I blog about?

Boring stuff, like:

-   Reproducibility.

-   Meta-science.

-   Cognitive neuroscience.

-   Data analysis.

And inspirational stuff, like:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="My love of David Bowie", fig.align='left', out.width="50%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/david-bowie-labyrinth.webp")
```

### Why should you read this blog?

You shouldn't - it will be a boring blog. Please go and do other things.

### Why is the blog called Chasing Rainbows?

For a long time, I just didn't trust a lot of what I was hearing at conferences or reading in journal articles. I'm naturally skeptical and maybe even a little cynical. But I had no proof and I am a scientist after all, so I remained quietly cynical at the back of the room. 
Then came the emprirical evidence in [2015](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716). Reproducibility in leading psychology journals was between 25% and 50%. Not so good. 

And so for a long time I've felt like a lot of science has been inherently chasing rainbows, pissing in the wind and engaging in Cargo Cult Science. 

I particularly like the idea of Cargo Cult Science from Richard Feynman [(.pdf)](./img/Feynman_74_CargoCult.pdf){target="_blank"}.
