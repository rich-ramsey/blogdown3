### Why am I writing a blog?

Two reasons. 1) Lab manual (of sorts). Save time re-saying things to SoBA-lab people, so it is efficient. 2) Open science. Why not make stuff open? Then other folks can benefit and I can benefit from feedback.

### What will I blog about?

-   Reproducibility.

-   Meta-science.

-   My love of David Bowie.
