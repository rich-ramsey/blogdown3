I am a Senior Scientist at ETH Zürich. My research interests span a range of topics in social and cognitive neuroscience, and my lab embraces recent developments in methods and meta-science. I am also a member of the Social Brain Sciences Laboratory ([SBS Lab](https://sbs.ethz.ch/)) and the Neural Control of Movement Laboratory ([NCM Lab](https://ncm.hest.ethz.ch/)).
