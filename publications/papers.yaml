# This .yaml file is simple text that lists relevant details of each separate publication
# It serves as the raw data for the publications.qmd file. The publications.qmd file is based on this blog:https://ddimmery.com/posts/quarto-website/
# I don't include some stuff, such as volume etc., because why bother.
# Note 1: put "yes" for the variable "in_press" if you want to denote that it is currently in press
# Note 2: This file is taken from a better bibtex file that is updated as part of my zotero folder "ramsey_pubs". I could used the .bib file to generate this list. However, even if that worked smoothly, it would still not have some stuff that I want e.g., pdf, neurovault and other stuff, so I'd ahve to ad thigns anyway. 
# Note 3: Papers are listed by first author surname (but they can be in any order).
# Note 4: just add a new chunk when you want to add a paper.
