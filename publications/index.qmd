<!-- 
This is the main publications page that uses Quarto's child document functionality to include either the R or Python implementation.

File structure:
- publications.qmd (this file): Main entry point that includes one of the implementations
- publications_r.qmd: R/tidyverse implementation of the publications page
- publications_python.qmd: Python implementation of the publications page

To switch between implementations:
1. Change the file name in the include statement below
2. From "publications_r.qmd" to "publications_python.qmd" or vice versa

Both implementations read from the same papers.yaml data file.

<!-- Including the R implementation currently -->

{{< include publications_r.qmd >}}
