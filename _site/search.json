Together, they motivate why the resources below have become an essential component to my lab’s research.\n\nJournal articles\n\nFalse positive psychology: 2011\nScientific Utopia: 2012\nEstimating reproducibility in psychology: 2015\nA manifesto for reproducible science: 2017\nPsychology’s Renaissance: 2018\nImplications for scientific practice: 2018\nReplicability, Robustness, and Reproducibility in Psychological Science: 2022\n\nBooks\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins of Psychology: 2017\nScience Fictions: 2021\n\n\n\n\nData analysis\nMy lab has been inspired to adopt a Bayesian estimation approach to statistical analysis. The general workflow follows Richard McElreath’s outstanding textbook and the translation into brms and Tidyverse by Solomon Kurz:\n\nStatistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath\nAnd Solomon Kurz’s ebook version, which is also AMAZING!\n\nHere are a bunch of other links to stats stuff that I’ve found really valuable to read:\n\nKruschke’s Doing Bayesian Data Analysis\nKruschke & Liddell. A good primer on the differences between frequentist and Bayesian analyses, as well as hypothesis testing and estimation approaches.\nBodo Winter’s book is a great introduction to estimation approaches. It provides great R code for beginners and uses frequentist language, which should be more familiar to most. It is a great place to start and provides a natural platform to thinking about the same estimation approaches in a Bayesian context.\nbrms is a fabulous tool in R for running Bayesian analyses in STAN\nGigerenzer’s statistical rituals paper\nOn statistical thinking more generally\nAnd why we need to do much more work before we think about running “tests” of hypotheses - Scheel and co.\n\n\n\nReproducible research\n\nVersion control in R.

One and Two\nA fabulous empirical demonstration on the lack of relevant validity in a very well-cited social perception task - by Wendy Higgins and co. here and here\n\n\n\nMaking a Quarto website\nI followed a whole bunch of posts to start a quarto website.

    "text": "Why am I writing a blog?\nTwo reasons.\n\nIt forms part of a lab manual (of sorts). It saves time re-saying things to SoBA-lab people or anyone else that cares to listen.\nOpen science.

Please go and do other things.\n\n\nWhy is the blog called Chasing Rainbows?\nFor a long time, I just didn’t trust a lot of what I was hearing at conferences or reading in journal articles. I’m naturally skeptical (and maybe even a little cynical, at times). But I had no proof to substantiate my distrust. And I’m an evidence-based scientist after all, so I remained quietly concerned at the back of the conference room.\nThen came the emprirical evidence in 2015. Reproducibility in leading psychology journals was between 25% and 50%. Not so good. Similar issues have emerged in a range of other fields, including human neuroscience (e.g., Button et al., 2013; Marek et al., 2022).\nThis evidence supported my instinct that a large proportion of psychological science and human neuroscience research had been unwittingly chasing rainbows, pissing in the wind or engaging in Cargo Cult Science.\nI particularly like the idea of Cargo Cult Science from Richard Feynman in 1974. Michael Hanlon (2013) summarises Feynman’s observation nicely:\n\nFeynman called things that looked like science but are not, ‘Cargo Cult Science’, after the cults that emerged on some South Pacific islands after the Second World War. The islanders had watched planes coming into land, and noticed that this was often accompanied by the appearance of valuable commodities from the outside world. So they built runways, control towers even, out of sticks and stones. But of course no planes came into land.\n\nOn first glance, this may seem like a far-fetched comparison to make towards modern science, with all the notions of serious scientists in white lab coats making groundbreaking innovations. But dig a little deeper and I’m not so sure. I think the observation remains profound and is even more relevant today than it was in 1974.\nIt is not that most researchers, including myself, intentionally used questionable research practices to produce unreliable research. Rather, the entire research ecosystem was setup in such a way that it inadvertently rewarded the production of unreliable research. We had the appearance of being scientists by wearing the right clothes, but we were working with the wrong tools and in the wrong environment.\nThis blog will be about small ways that we can try to avoid chasing rainbows.\n\n\nHungry for more?\nThen read my blog post with Emily about our lab’s efforts to embrace open science.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ramsey2023,\n  author = {Ramsey, Richard},\n  title = {A Blog about (Not) Chasing Rainbows},\n  date = {2023-05-10},\n  url = {https://rich-ramsey.com/posts/2023-05-10_chasing_rainbows_intro},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRamsey, Richard. 2023. “A Blog about (Not) Chasing\nRainbows.” May 10, 2023. https://rich-ramsey.com/posts/2023-05-10_chasing_rainbows_intro."
