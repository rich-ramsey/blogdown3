    "section": "",
    "text": "Why am I writing a blog?\nTwo reasons.\n\nIt forms part of a lab manual (of sorts). It saves time re-saying things to SoBA-lab people or anyone else that cares to listen.\nOpen science. Why not make stuff open? Then other folks can benefit and I can benefit from feedback.\n\n\n\nWhat will I blog about?\nBoring stuff, like:\n\nReproducibility.\nMeta-science.\nCognitive neuroscience.\nData analysis.\n\nAnd inspirational stuff, like:\n\n\n\n\n\nMy love of David Bowie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should you read this blog?\nYou shouldn’t - it will be a boring blog. Please go and do other things.\n\n\nWhy is the blog called Chasing Rainbows?\nFor a long time, I just didn’t trust a lot of what I was hearing at conferences or reading in journal articles. I’m naturally skeptical (and maybe even a little cynical, at times). But I had no proof to substantiate my distrust. And I’m an evidence-based scientist after all, so I remained quietly concerned at the back of the conference room.\nThen came the empirical evidence in 2015. Reproducibility in leading psychology journals was between 25% and 50%. Not so good. Similar issues have emerged in a range of other fields, including human neuroscience (e.g., Button et al., 2013; Marek et al., 2022).\nThis evidence supported my instinct that a large proportion of psychological science and human neuroscience research had been unwittingly chasing rainbows, pissing in the wind or engaging in Cargo Cult Science.\nI particularly like the idea of Cargo Cult Science from Richard Feynman in 1974. Michael Hanlon (2013) summarises Feynman’s observation nicely:\n\nFeynman called things that looked like science but are not, ‘Cargo Cult Science’, after the cults that emerged on some South Pacific islands after the Second World War. The islanders had watched planes coming into land, and noticed that this was often accompanied by the appearance of valuable commodities from the outside world. So they built runways, control towers even, out of sticks and stones. But of course no planes came into land.\n\nOn first glance, this may seem like a far-fetched comparison to make towards modern science, with all the notions of serious scientists in white lab coats making groundbreaking innovations. But dig a little deeper and I’m not so sure. I think the observation remains profound and is even more relevant today than it was in 1974.\nIt is not that most researchers, including myself, intentionally used questionable research practices to produce unreliable research. Rather, the entire research ecosystem was setup in such a way that it inadvertently rewarded the production of unreliable research. We had the appearance of being scientists by wearing the right clothes, but we were working with the wrong tools and in the wrong environment.\nThis blog will be about small ways that we can try to avoid chasing rainbows.\n\n\nHungry for more?\nThen read my blog post with Emily about our lab’s efforts to embrace open science.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ramsey2023,\n  author = {Ramsey, Richard},\n  title = {A Blog about (Not) Chasing Rainbows},\n  date = {2023-05-10},\n  url = {https://rich-ramsey.com/posts/2023-05-10_chasing_rainbows_intro},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRamsey, Richard. 2023. “A Blog about (Not) Chasing\nRainbows.” May 10, 2023. https://rich-ramsey.com/posts/2023-05-10_chasing_rainbows_intro."

    "text": "A cornerstone of scientific study is the ability to accumulate knowledge over time in a progressive manner. However, threats exist that limit the steady accumulation of knowledge.\nAs poignantly remarked in 1974, Richard Feynman warned against the perils of pseudoscience and the relative ease with which scientists can be fooled into believing things that do not stand up to scientific study or reflect reality (.pdf). His now famous quote is as relevant as ever:\n\nThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.\n\nThe open science movement is concerned with providing a scientific platform to prevent scientists from fooling themselves, as well as each other.​"

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\np-hacking or data dredging refers to the process of analysing data until a statistically significant pattern emerges, without first devising a specific hypothesis or a pre-determined analysis pipeline.↩︎\nA complementary approach would be to employ approaches developed from machine learning that aim to predict out-of-sample effects using cross-validation methods (Yarkoni & Westfall, 2017). Such machine learning approaches can be data-efficient by avoiding the requirement to collect an additional dataset and permit left-out runs to be used as independent data.↩︎\nThere are several reasons why data cannot be shared publicly, such as if individuals could be identified or if another organisation controls access to the data. But in our experience, the vast majority of data produced in psychology and human neuroscience research can be shared publicly.↩︎"
