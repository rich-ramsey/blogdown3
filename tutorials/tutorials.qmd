Some of the below are tutorials that include step-by-step instructions, whereas others just represent some of my coding projects with comments.

The topics covered are all connected to open science, meta-science and reproducibility and available via my [GitHub](https://github.com/rich-ramsey) account.

## A reproducible scientific workflow in R and R Studio ##

This project tries to outline a reproducible scientific workflow using R and R Studio that starts with raw data and ends with the finished manuscript.

## A Bayesian workflow ##

This project takes aspects of the Bayesian workflow paper by Gelman and colleagues and applies them to an example scenario in experimental psychology.

## A PsychoPy Tutorial ##

This tutorial is intended as a one-stop guide to understanding and using PsychoPy/Pavlovia. Andrew Wildman was the primary author.

## Data simulation to determine sample sizes ##

This project simulates multi-level data for a range of factorial designs.

And this one does the same for "small-N" designs, where trial counts per participant are particularly important.

## Analysing pupilomoetry data using hgams ##

This project tries to provide an example of how you might model pupilometry data using hierarchical generalised additive models (hgams).
